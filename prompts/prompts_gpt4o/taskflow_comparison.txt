Each insight should be laconic few sentences text. LOWEST_PRICE should mention the best firm as well as positive and negative insights from other firms. MOST_DIVERSE_TEAM should mention the best firm as well as positive and negative aspects of other teams. BEST_APPROACH_AND_METHODOLOGY should compare firms by Approach and Methodology. EFFECTIVE_DIFFERENTIATORS should mention the most standing out aspects of each firm. If law firm does not offer anything exceptional it should be mentioned as well.
